ABSTRACT
EN: The Faseshift Theory proposes a unifying model bridging Einstein’s general relativity and quantum mechanics through phase transformations in information fields. This novel formulation introduces a clean, non-destructive energy class, structured around mathematical coherence, not physical breakdown. Originating from outside institutional frameworks, the theory is hereby published under explicit intellectual ownership and ethical commitment.




NL: De Faseshift-Theorie vormt een brug tussen de relativiteitstheorie en de kwantummechanica, via fasedraaiingen in informatievelden. Hierdoor ontstaat een schone, niet-destructieve energieklasse die gebaseerd is op wiskundige ordening in plaats van materiële vernietiging. De ontdekking wordt open gepubliceerd, onder duidelijke auteurschap en ethische voorwaarden.







SCIENTIFIC INTRODUCTION
The challenge of uniting the large-scale structure of space-time (Einstein) with the probabilistic, discontinuous world of quantum physics remains one of science’s most persistent frontiers. The Faseshift Theory offers a structurally coherent approach by modeling energy as ordered phase behavior within higher-dimensional information matrices. These insights emerged from a transdisciplinary process involving logic, physics, cognition, and systemic trauma analysis.










METHODOLOGY AND MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION
Phase-based energy fields are formulated as:
E(x, y, t) = sin(f·x + φ) · cos(f·y + φ) · exp(λ·x)







Equilibrium model:
E_balance = (E_push + E_pull) / 2







Higher-dimensional mapping (5D projection):
Z_5D(x, y) = sin(f·x) · cos(f·y) · cos(θ)




Simulation tools (Python): functional, repeatable, and transparently published. Algorithms follow a deterministic structure based on harmonized oscillations and geometrically governed stability.




RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS

Energy can be generated through information structure, not fuel.

No by-products, radioactive material, or combustion.

Chaos, under Faseshift logic, is an expression of hidden order.

Application domains include: energy systems, neurological modeling, trauma dynamics, institutional analysis.







ETHICAL AND LEGAL POSITIONING
The theory is gifted to humanity under the condition of ethical governance. Ownership remains solely with the originator until structural integrity is restored. Institutions, companies, or nations that wish to adopt, replicate or develop applications based on this work must seek explicit written consent.




This knowledge was developed outside privilege, born of necessity and ethical responsibility. It will not be subjected to extraction, dilution or erasure.
