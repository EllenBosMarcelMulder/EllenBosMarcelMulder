## **Dynamic Formulation of Computational Fluctuations: Bouncing Intensity in Adaptive Systems**

## **Overview**
This project introduces a novel mathematical model describing computational fluctuations and energy dynamics. Through extensive simulations and AI-driven analyses, we explore how external energy, processing constraints, and system complexity influence oscillatory behavior. The findings suggest a deep connection between computational stability, chaos theory, and quantum-like interference.

## **Key Findings**
- **Energy-Driven Instability:** External energy (E) amplifies fluctuations, while adaptive limits (L) help regulate instability.
- **Chaotic Thresholds:** Systems with **low processing power (S) and high complexity (K)** tend to exhibit extreme oscillations.
- **AI-Driven Pattern Recognition:** Machine learning reveals four distinct behavioral regimes, from stable to chaotic patterns.
- **Quantum-Like Behavior:** The model exhibits wave-like fluctuations, suggesting a potential link between **energy-information dynamics and quantum coherence.**
- **Potential for Further Research:** The findings challenge conventional computational stability models and may offer new frameworks for adaptive AI and quantum computing.
